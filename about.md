## Monkey Tales

These are stories that I have written for my children (the titular monkeys).

## Monkeys

The monkeys in question are my children, three of whom can be likened, in a sense, to monkeys that I found up a tree and the fourth is more usefully thought of as a woodland creature of the forest floor, having been found not up a tree. However, as a general term, it is easier to refer to them collectively as monkeys, something I frequently do.
